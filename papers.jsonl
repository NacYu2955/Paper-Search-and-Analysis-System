Traditionally, the convergence of these algorithms is indirectly analyzed via certain deterministic continuous time (DCT) systems. Such a method will require the learning rate to converge to zero, which is not a reasonable requirement to impose in many practical applications. Recently, deterministic discrete time (DDT) systems have been proposed instead to indirectly interpret the dynamics of the learning algorithms. Unlike DCT systems, DDT systems allow learning rates to be constant (which can be a nonzero). This paper will provide some important results relating to the convergence of a DDT system of Oja's PCA learning algorithm. It has the following contributions: 1) A number of invariant sets are obtained, based on which we can show that any trajectory starting from a point in the invariant set will remain in the set forever. Thus, the nondivergence of the trajectories is guaranteed. 2) The convergence of the DDT system is analyzed rigorously. It is proven, in the paper, that almost all trajectories of the system starting from points in an invariant set will converge exponentially to the unit eigenvector associated with the largest eigenvalue of the correlation matrix. In addition, exponential convergence rate are obtained, providing useful guidelines for the selection of fast convergence learning rate. 3) Since the trajectories may diverge, the careful choice of initial vectors is an important issue. This paper suggests to use the domain of unit hyper sphere as initial vectors to guarantee convergence. 4) Simulation results will be furnished to illustrate the theoretical results achieved.", "author": "Yi, Zhang and Ye, Mao and Lv, Jian Cheng and Tan, Kok Kiong", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks", "volume": "16", "number": "6", "pages": "1318--1328", "year": "2005", "publisher": "IEEE"}

Affinity propagation (AP) is an effective algorithm that identifies exemplars among data points by recursively sending real valued messages between pairs of data points. AP calculates the message using the similarity among data points. Hence, the construction of similarity graph lies in the heart of the AP algorithm. A common choice for similarity is negative Euclidean distance. However, most data points, especial high-dimensional data, lies into the non-Euclidean space such that Euclidean distance cannot capture the real structure of data. Moreover, Euclidean distance is sensitive to noise and outliers such that the performance of the algorithm will be degraded when data are grossly corrupted. In this paper, we propose an algorithm, named as Sparse Affinity Propagation (SAP), which adopts sparse representation coefficient to depict the relationship among data points. For a given data set, SAP calculates the sparse representation for each data point by solving a convex problem; and then, builds a similarity graph using the representation coefficient; after that, obtains the exemplars by performing AP over the sparse similarity graph. To verify the efficacy of our algorithm, we carried out numerous experiments in the context of data summarization.

In this paper, a non-negative representation learning algorithm is proposed to select the neighbors of a data point, so that they are almost always lying in the tangent space of the manifold at the given query point. This is very important to multi-manifold clustering and manifold embedding. Convex geometry theory states that a data point on a face of a convex polytope can be a convex combination of the vertices of the polytope, and that the non-zero combination scalars correspond to the vertices of the face the point lies on. The intent of this paper is to use points that that are near to a point as the vertices of a convex polytope, and select the vertices on the same face as this point to be the neighbors. Clearly, the point can be a convex combination of its neighbors. We can observe that these neighbors almost always lie in the tangent space of the manifold at the query point and can preserve the local manifold structure well. Based on this basic idea, we construct an objective function. Moreover, an augmented Lagrange multipliers method is proposed for solving it to derive a non-negative representation, and then the neighbors of a data point can be obtained. The result of our neighbor selection algorithm can be used by other clustering methods such as LEM or manifold embedding methods such as LLE.

Since data representation can uncover the intrinsic data structure, we present an efficient representation-based method for detecting such points, which are generally located around the margin of densely distributed data, such as a cluster. For each point, the negative components in its representation generally correspond to the boundary points among its affine combination of points. In the presented method, the reverse unreachability of a point is proposed to evaluate to what degree this observation is a boundary point. The reverse unreachability can be calculated by counting the number of zero and negative components in the representation. The reverse unreachability explicitly takes into account the global data structure and reveals the disconnectivity between a data point and other points. This paper reveals that the reverse unreachability of points with lower density has a higher score. Note that the score of reverse unreachability of an outlier is greater than that of a boundary point. The top-m ranked points can thus be identified as outliers. The greater the value of the reverse unreachability, the more likely the point is a boundary point.

In this paper, we learn the feature representation of images and their sentence descriptions by different deep neural networks to learn about the inner-modal correspondences between visual and language data. We then use a joint embedding structure based on angle calculation for measuring the semantic similarity between visual and textual features. In the proposed method, a constant factor b keeps the similarities of positive samples and negative samples at a certain distance.

That is, the documents can be grouped based on their distribution on words, while words can be grouped based on their distribution on documents. However, traditional co-clustering methods are usually sensitive to the input affinity matrix since they partition the data based on the fixed data graph. To address this limitation, in this paper, based on nonnegative matrix tri-factorization, we propose a new framework of co-clustering with adaptive local structure learning. The proposed unified learning framework performs intrinsic structure learning and tri-factorization (i.e., 3-factor factorization) simultaneously. The intrinsic structure is adaptively learned from the results of tri-factorization, and the factors are reformulated to preserve the refined local structures of the textual data. In this way, the local structure learning and factorization can be mutually improved. Furthermore, considering the duality between documents and words, the proposed framework explores not only the adaptive local structure of the data space, but also the adaptive local structure of the feature space.

Moreover, the collaborative representation-based face recognition has been extensively studied because of the effective classification performance of CRC. CRC collaboratively represents each query sample as the linear combination of all the training samples and then classifies the query sample according to the categorical representation-based distances. However, most variants of CRC cannot fully consider the locality and discrimination of data and cannot well handle the noise data, which has negative effect on real-world classification problems, such as face recognition. In this paper, a new discriminative collaborative neighbor representation (DCNR) method for face recognition is proposed by integrating class discrimination and data locality. In the proposed method, the locality of data constrains collaborative representation of each query sample to find representative nearest samples of the query sample.

Despite significant research efforts, downbeat tracking still remains a challenge. Previous researches either focus on feature engineering (extracting certain features by signal processing, which are semi-automatic solutions); or have some limitations: they can only model music audio recordings within limited time signatures and tempo ranges. Recently, deep learning has surpassed traditional machine learning methods and has become the primary algorithm in feature learning; the combination of traditional and deep learning methods also has made better performance. In this paper, we begin with a background introduction of downbeat tracking problem. Then, we give detailed discussions of the following topics: system architecture, feature extraction, deep neural network algorithms, data sets, and evaluation strategy. In addition, we take a look at the results from the annual benchmark evaluation—Music Information Retrieval Evaluation eXchange—as well as the developments in software implementations.

However, geographical differences complicate the spatio-temporal evolutionary characteristics of farmland landscape systems, making them difficult to explore. This creates a series of difficulties in designing farmland management policy in China's diversified geographical environment. This study aims to explore the evolution of laws and dynamic mechanisms of farmland landscape structural changes in different geographical environments at the provincial level in China. A landscape structure classification model at the pixel level was developed using the principles of range attenuation in geographical space and ecological boundary effects to identify the spatial characteristics of the degradation processes in farmland landscapes. A redundancy analysis (RDA) investigated the human and natural causes of farmland landscape degradation processes. The results demonstrate that the farmland landscape systems in Jiangsu Province degraded between the 1980s and 2010 on a spatial gradient with human geography: the beginnings of industrialisation → rapid industrialisation → completion of industrialisation. Degradation manifested temporal and spatial differentiation as follows: fragmentation via the joint activities of invasion from non-agricultural boundaries and internal wedging → fragmentation caused by non-agricultural internal wedging → fragmentation caused by boundary invasion. The core causal factors of degradation were development intensity and the extent of construction land, which indicate changes in socioeconomic development. Industrialisation and rapid urbanisation increased the development intensity of human construction, which disrupted the connections among farmland landscapes through boundary invasions or discontinuous occupations. This subsequent fragmentation of farmland landscape patterns degraded the productive and ecological functions of farmlands. This study indicates that development intensity around agricultural environments should be strictly controlled which would be beneficial for the design of farmland conservation policies and land management in China.", "author": "Jiang, Penghui and Li, Manchun and Lv, Jiancheng", "journal": "Science of the total environment", "volume": "685", "pages": "667--680", "year": "2019", "publisher": "Elsevier"}

MicroRNA-124 (miR-124) was revealed to be an attractive prognostic tumour biomarker in recent studies. However, the results remain inconclusive. Hence, this meta-analysis was carried out to clarify the precise predictive value of miR-124. Materials and Methods. Relevant studies were searched in PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library up to October 2018. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were extracted from the selected studies. Results. A total of 29 articles investigating the correlation between miR-124 expression and prognosis were initially identified. The pooled HR for overall survival (OS) of high miR-124 expression in multiple cancers was 0.55 (95%CI = 0.50–0.61). Disease-free survival (DFS)/progression-free survival (HR = 0.48, 95%CI = 0.38–0.61) revealed a protective role of increased miR-124 expression. Epigenetic hypermethylation of miR-124 mediated the silencing of its expression, which is correlated significantly with unfavourable survival (OS: HR = 2.06, 95%CI = 1.68–2.53; DFS/recurrence-free survival: HR = 2.77, 95%CI = 1.85–4.16). Conclusions. Taken together, our results suggest that miR-124 plays an antioncogenic role in various tumors, such as lung cancer and colorectal cancer. If methylation of miR-124 could be prevented, progression and metastasis would be improved; thus, miR-124 may be a promising biomarker and novel therapeutic target. Further large-scale studies are needed to confirm this possible effect.", "author": "Zhou, Zijian and Lv, Jiancheng and Wang, Jingzi and Yu, Hao and Lu, Hongcheng and Yuan, Baorui and Han, Jie and Zhou, Rui and Zhang, Xiaolei and Yang, Xiao and others", "journal": "Disease markers", "volume": "2019", "number": "1", "pages": "1654780", "year": "2019", "publisher": "Hindawi"}

In recent years, several approaches have been proposed with the aim of developing a robust algorithm which functions in complex and cluttered environments. Although several researchers have addressed this challenging problem, a robust system is still elusive. Therefore, we propose a deep learning-based architecture to jointly detect and classify hand gestures. In the proposed architecture, the whole image is passed through a one-stage dense object detector to extract hand regions, which, in turn, pass through a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) for hand gesture recognition. To evaluate our approach, we conducted extensive experiments on four publicly available datasets for hand detection, including the Oxford, 5-signers, EgoHands, and Indian classical dance (ICD) datasets, along with two hand gesture datasets with different gesture vocabularies for hand gesture recognition, namely, the LaRED and TinyHands datasets.

With VAE and GAN as the basic components, we propose Cycle Conditional-VAE-GAN (Cycle CVAE-GAN) to tackle the problem within four steps.

A structural analysis of NPC can provide vital insights into methods of treatment. However, manually marking the boundaries of NPC in images is tedious, time-consuming, and prone to error. It has become necessary to use computer-based automatic segmentation algorithms to accurately locate NPC. However, this remains a challenging task owing to the high variation (in shape and size) in the structure of the nasopharynx across subjects. Moreover, the nasopharyngeal area is small, and this causes severe imbalance in the foreground and background categories. In this paper, we propose a 3D convolutional neural network with long-range skip connection and multi-scale feature pyramid (SFP) for the segmentation of images of NPC. Unlike the traditional skip connection in residual blocks, which only considers the feature transfer and feature fusion between the same convolutional layer, long-range skip connection with original features from the first convolution in our network is passed to each down-sampling stage using element-wise sum to effectively increase reuse of low-level features and to solve the problems of gradient disappearance and explosion. The multi-scale feature pyramid with a varying atrous rate adapts to images of different sizes to learn multi-scale features, and hierarchical contextual information regarding NPC. To accelerate the convergence of our network, we use deep supervision to generate three auxiliary segmentation maps and merge the weighted loss into the objective function. And we fuse these auxiliary segmentation maps to refine the final segmentation result. In our experiments, the proposed network was trained and tested on 3D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images of 120 clinical patients using 5-fold cross-validation. The average dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and average symmetric surface distance (ASSD), used as evaluation metric, were 0.737 and 1.214 mm, respectively.

In total, 853 DEGs were obtained, including 363 upregulated genes and 490 downregulated genes. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis of DEGs were performed to obtain enrichment datasets. GO analysis showed that DEGs were significantly enriched in the extracellular region, cell-cell signaling, hormone activity, and cytokine activity. KEGG pathway analysis revealed that the DEGs were mainly enriched in the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, drug metabolism, androgen and estrogen metabolism, and neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction. The Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network of DEGs was constructed by using Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes (STRING). The app MCODE plugged in Cytoscape was used to explore the key modules involved in disease development. 43 key genes involved in the top two modules were identified.

It greatly alleviates catastrophic forgetting but cannot totally eliminate it. To overcome this shortcoming and further solve the challenging issue, in this article, we propose a novel approach named asynchronous dual-channel online restricted Boltzmann machine, where online CD with dual-channel GR plays an important role in further eliminating catastrophic forgetting. The asynchronous gradient estimation, by which the Markov chain sampling and the network calculation are conducted asynchronously on separate computing nodes, is designed to speed up training. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms several algorithms in increasing training speed and minimizing catastrophic forgetting. Besides, online learning with dual-channel can be effectively extended to other online learning neural networks with GR and has achieved excellent results in our verification experiments.", "author": "Liu, Dongbo and He, Zhenan and Chen, Dongdong and Lv, Jiancheng", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems", "volume": "52", "number": "1", "pages": "415--425", "year": "2020", "publisher": "IEEE"}

Recently, the neural network-based methods have demonstrated their promising performance in segmenting the heart sound data.

The reason is largely due to that the envelope features cannot effectively model the intrinsic sequential characteristic, resulting in the poor utilization of the duration information of heart cycles.

We analyzed patient records for all laboratory-confirmed cases reported in the province for the period of January 21 to March 16, 2020.

In 2006, the seroepidemiologic data from Tianjin area demonstrated average infection prevalences in farm population as 8.8% similar to rates among serosurveys in North America and Europe. In this study, we describe a continuous seroprevalence investigation of A. phagocytophilum in Tianjin areas from 2007 to 2009. Methods: Field epidemiological surveys were performed in 8 districts of Tianjin and 886 farmers were randomly recruited and their serum samples were collected to detect the specific IgG antibodies of A. phagocytophilum by micro indirect immunoflorescence (IFA). Results: The IgG antibody positive rates of A. phagocy tophilum increased from 8.8% in 2006 to 59.2% in 2009 while E. chaffeensis had an increase from 0.0% in 2006 to 4.4% in 2009. However, spotted fever group rickettsiae decreased from 1.6% in 2007 to 0.0% in 2009.

The core operation block of GCN is the convolutional layer, which enables the network to construct node embeddings by fusing both attributes of nodes and relationships between nodes. Different features or feature interactions inherently have various influences on the convolutional layers. However, there are very limited studies about the impact of feature importance in GCN-related communities. In this work, we attempt to augment convolutional layers in GCNs with statistical attention-based feature importance by modeling the latent interactions of features, which is complementary to the standard GCNs and only needs simple calculations with statistics rather than heavy trainings. To this end, we treat the feature input of each convolutional layer as a separate multi-layer heterogeneous graph, and propose Graph Statistical Self-Attention (GSSA) method to automatically learn the hierarchical structure of feature importance. More specifically, we propose two modules in GSSA, Channel-wise Self-Attention (CSA) to capture the dependencies between feature channels, and Mean-based Self-Attention (MSA) to reweight similarities among features. Aiming at each graph convolutional layer, GSSA can be applied in a ”plug and play” way for a wide range of GCN variants. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation that optimizes GCNs from the feature importance perspective. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GSSA can promote existing popular baselines remarkably in semi-supervised node classification tasks.

In this article, we propose Overlap-FedAvg, an innovative framework that loosed the chain-like constraint of federated learning and paralleled the model training phase with the model communication phase (i.e., uploading local models and downloading the global model), so that the latter phase could be totally covered by the former phase. Compared to vanilla FedAvg, Overlap-FedAvg was further developed with a hierarchical computing strategy, a data compensation mechanism, and a nesterov accelerated gradients (NAG) algorithm. In Particular, Overlap-FedAvg is orthogonal to many other compression methods so that they could be applied together to maximize the utilization of the cluster. Besides, the theoretical analysis is provided to prove the convergence of the proposed framework. Extensive experiments conducting on both image classification and natural language processing tasks with multiple models and datasets also demonstrate that the proposed framework substantially reduced the communication overhead and boosted the federated learning process.", "author": "Zhou, Yuhao and Ye, Qing and Lv, Jiancheng", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems", "volume": "33", "number": "1", "pages": "192--205", "year": "2021", "publisher": "IEEE"}

PATIENTS AND METHODS: The expression levels of circ-ABCB10, miR-620 and FABP5 mRNA in glioma tissues, normal surrounding tissues and glioma cell lines were measured by Real-time PCR (RT-PCR). Circ-ABCB10 was silenced by siRNA in glioma cell lines (U87, T98G). The proliferation, migration and invasion of glioma cells were measured by MTT, wound healing and transwell assays, respectively. The relationship between circ-ABCB10, miR-620 and FABP5 was tested by Dual-Luciferase assay. The expression of proteins was measured by Western blot. The cell cycle distribution and apoptosis were measured by flow cytometry. RESULTS: The expression levels of circ-ABCB10 and FABP5 in glioma tissues and cells were significantly higher than those in their normal counterparts. Moreover, the expression of miR-620 was lower in glioma tissues. Silencing of circ-ABCB10 in glioma cells significantly inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion of glioma cells. Moreover, downregulation of circ-ABCB10 induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in glioma cells. Furthermore, inhibition of miR-620 showed the opposite effects to silencing circ-ABCB10 on glioma cells. Dual-Luciferase reporter assays demonstrated that circ-ABCB10 could bind to miR-620 and that FABP5 was a direct target of miR-620. Western blot results showed that circ-ABCB10 could stabilize the expression of FABP5, while miR-620 decreased the expression of FABP5. Furthermore, overexpression of FABP5 abrogated the silencing effects of circ-ABCB10 in glioma cells. 6848 CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that circ-ABCB10 affects glioma progression by regulating the miR-620/FABP5 axis, and circ-ABCB10 might be used as a potential target for the treatment of glioma", "author": "Sun, W-Y and Lu, Y-F and Cai, X-L and Li, Z-Z and Lv, J and Xiang, Y-A and Chen, J-J and Chen, W-J and Liu, X-M and Chen, J-B", "journal": "European Review for Medical \\& Pharmacological Sciences", "volume": "24", "number": "12", "year": "2020"}

Different EA-based NAS algorithms may utilize different encoding schemes for network representation, while they have the same workflow. Specifically, the first step is the initialization of the population with different encoding schemes, and the second step is the evaluation of the individuals by the fitness function. Then, the EA-based NAS algorithm executes evolution operations, e.g., selection, mutation, and crossover, to eliminate weak individuals and generate more competitive ones. Lastly, evolution continues until the max generation and the best neural architectures will be chosen. Because each individual needs complete training and validation on the target dataset, the EA-based NAS always consumes significant computation and time inevitably, which results in the bottleneck of this approach. To ameliorate this issue, this article proposes a distributed framework to boost the computation of the EA-based NAS algorithm. This framework is a server/worker model where the server distributes individuals requested by the computing nodes and collects the validated individuals and hosts the evolution operations. Meanwhile, the most time-consuming phase (i.e., individual evaluation) of the EA-based NAS is allocated to the computing nodes, which send requests asynchronously to the server and evaluate the fitness values of the individuals. Additionally, a new packet structure of the message delivered in the cluster is designed to encapsulate various network representations and support different EA-based NAS algorithms. We design an EA-based NAS algorithm as a case to investigate the efficiency of the proposed framework. Extensive experiments are performed on an illustrative cluster with different scales, and the results reveal that the framework can achieve a nearly linear reduction of the search time with the increase of the computational nodes.

In this paper, we propose to simultaneously and explicitly leverage the multi-view consistency and the multi-view diversity in a unified framework.

However, DKT often ignores the inherent differences between students (e.g. memory skills, reasoning skills, ...), averaging the performances of all students, leading to the lack of personalization, and therefore was considered insufficient for adaptive learning.

Secondly, the pivot module was utilized to dynamically reconstruct the decoder of the neural network on attention of the extracted features, successfully distinguishing the performance between students over time. Moreover, inspired by Item Response Theory (IRT), the interpretable Rasch model was used to cluster students by their ability levels, and thereby utilizing leveled learning to assign different encoders to different groups of students. With pivot module reconstructed the decoder for individual students and leveled learning specialized encoders for groups, personalized DKT was achieved.

Increasing data has proved that circRNA can influence the development and progression of tumors. CircFAM114A2 is generated from several exons of FAM114A2. However, the function and mechanisms of circFAM114A2 in bladder cancer (BCa) remain unclear. Methods: Here, to elucidate the potential roles of circFAM114A2 in BCa, we conducted RNA-sequencing on 5 pairs of BCa samples and screened for circRNAs. CircRNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs) and mRNAs, as well as levels of P27 and P21, in human cells and tissues were detected by qRT-PCR and western blot, respectively. CircRNA-miRNA interactions and miRNA-downstream mRNAs interactions were investigated by RNA pull-down assay and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or luciferase reporter assays, respectively. Then, the function of circFAM114A2 in BCa was explored using cell proliferation, cell cycle and tumorigenesis assays in nude mice. Finally, the function of circFAM114A2 in cisplatin chemo-sensitivity in BCa was detected by IC50 and tumor formation of xenograft in cisplatin-treated nude mice. Results: We discovered that circFAM114A2 levels were decreased in BCa cell lines and tissues. According to follow-up data, BCa patients with higher circFAM114A2 expression had better survival. Importantly, the levels of circFAM114A2 were associated with the histological grade of BCa. Overexpression of circFAM114A2 inhibited cell proliferation and increased sensitivity to cisplatin chemotherapy. Mechanistically, circFAM114A2 directly sponged miR-222-3p/miR-146a-5p and subsequently influenced the expression of the downstream target genes P27/P21, which, in turn, inhibited progression of BCa. Conclusion: In conclusion, circFAM114A2 acted as a tumor suppressor through a novel circFAM114A2/miR-222-3p/P27 and circFAM114A2/miR-146a-5p/P21 pathway.

To generate plausible haze, we study two less-touched but challenging problems in hazy image rendering, namely, i) how to estimate the transmission map from a single image without auxiliary information, and ii) how to adaptively learn the airlight from exemplars, i.e., unpaired real hazy images. To this end, we propose a neural rendering method for image hazing, dubbed as HazeGEN. To be specific, HazeGEN is a knowledge-driven neural network which estimates the transmission map by leveraging a new prior, i.e., there exists the structure similarity (e.g., contour and luminance) between the transmission map and the input clean image. To adaptively learn the airlight, we build a neural module based on another new prior, i.e., the rendered hazy image and the exemplar are similar in the airlight distribution. To the best of our knowledge, this could be the first attempt to deeply render hazy images in an unsupervised fashion. Compared with existing haze generation methods, HazeGEN renders the hazy images in an unsupervised, learnable, and controllable manner, thus avoiding the labor-intensive efforts in paired data collection and the domain-shift issue in haze generation.

A common solution often resorts to sequence-level knowledge distillation by rebuilding the training dataset through autoregressive generation (hereinafter known as “teacher AG”). The success of such methods may largely depend on a latent assumption, i.e., the teacher AG is superior to the NAG model. However, in this work, we experimentally reveal that this assumption does not always hold for the text generation tasks like text summarization and story ending generation. To provide a feasible solution to the multimodality problem of NAG, we propose incorporating linguistic structure (Part-of-Speech sequence in particular) into NAG inference instead of relying on teacher AG. More specifically, the proposed POS-constrained Parallel Decoding (POSPD) method aims at providing a specific POS sequence to constrain the NAG model during decoding.

Thus, in the proposed CMDL method, we introduce an object detection network based on YOLO-v3 to detect the focus areas we need, so as to reduce the interference of noise and improve the cataract detection accuracy of our method. Considering that the B-ultrasound image dataset we collected is small-scale, we also design three feature extraction modules to avoid over-fitting of the deep neural networks. Among them, there are a depth features extraction module based on DenseNet-161, a shape features extractor based on Fourier descriptor, and a texture features extraction module based on gray-level co-occurrence matrix. Moreover, we also introduce the collaborative learning module to improve the generalization of the proposed model. Specifically, we first fuse the depth, shape, and texture features of the eyeball and lens, respectively.

As the population ages, the incidence of cataracts is on the rise. Early diagnosis and treatment are essential for cataracts. The routine early diagnosis relies on B-scan eye ultrasound images, developing deep learning-based automatic cataract detection makes great sense. However, ultrasound images are complex and contain irrelevant backgrounds, the lens takes up only a small part. Besides, detection networks commonly use only one label as supervision, which leads to low classification accuracy and poor generalization. This paper focuses on making the most of the information in the images, thus proposing a new paradigm for automatic cataract detection. First, an object detection network is included to locate the eyeball area and eliminate the influence of the background. Next, we construct a dataset with multiple labels for each image. We extract the text descriptions of ultrasound images into labels so that each image is tagged with multiple labels. Then we applied the multi-task learning (MTL) methods to cataract detection.

In the proposed method, our generator network mainly consists of three-layer stacked encoder-decoder architecture, which could fuse different level feature information and achieve image inpainting via a coarse-to-fine hierarchical representation.

First, they adopt a siamese dual-encoder architecture to encode queries and documents independently for fast indexing and searching, while neglecting the finer-grained term-wise interactions. This results in a sub-optimal recall performance. Second, their model training highly relies on a negative sampling technique to build up the negative documents in their contrastive losses. To address these challenges, we present Adversarial Retriever-Ranker (AR2), which consists of a dual-encoder retriever plus a cross-encoder ranker. The two models are jointly optimized according to a minimax adversarial objective: the retriever learns to retrieve negative documents to cheat the ranker, while the ranker learns to rank a collection of candidates including both the ground-truth and the retrieved ones, as well as providing progressive direct feedback to the dual-encoder retriever. Through this adversarial game, the retriever gradually produces harder negative documents to train a better ranker, whereas the cross-encoder ranker provides progressive feedback to improve retriever. We evaluate AR2 on three benchmarks. Experimental results show that AR2 consistently and significantly outperforms existing dense retriever methods and achieves new state-of-the-art results on all of them.

CircZNF609 (hsa_circ_0000615) has been shown to serve as an oncogene in all kinds of solid tumors and may act as the novel biomarker in tumor diagnosis and therapy in tumor early diagnosis and therapy. However, the underlying character and mechanism of circZNF609 in cisplatin chemosensitivity and bladder cancer (BCa) development were unknown. The expression level of cell division cycle 25B (CDC25B), microRNA 1200 (miR-1200), and circZNF609 in BCa cells and tissues depended on quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). CDC25B protein level was assayed with Western blot. Functional assays in vitro and in vivo had been conducted to inspect the important role of circZNF609 on BCa progression and cisplatin chemosensitivity in BCa. RNA sequencing and online databases were used to predict the interactions among circZNF609, miR-1200, and CDC25B. Mechanistic exploration was confirmed by RNA pull-down assay, RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and Dual luciferase reporter assay. CircZNF609 expression was increased significantly in BCa cell lines and tissues. For BCa patients, increased expression of circZNF609 was correlated with a worse survival. In vitro and in vivo, enforced expression of circZNF609 enhanced BCa cells proliferation, migration, and cisplatin chemoresistance. Mechanistically, circZNF609 alleviated the inhibition effect on target CDC25B expression by sponging miR-1200.

Methods: A total of 196 patients with pathologically confirmed bladder cancer, namely, 141 non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) and 55 muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) patients. There were 32 patients who received cisplatin-based neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) followed by radical cystectomy (RC). Subtraction enrichment combined with immunostaining-fluorescence in situ hybridization (SE-iFISH) strategy was used for CTC/CEC detection. Kaplan–Meier analysis and Cox regression were used to evaluate the overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). Receiver operator characteristic analysis was used to discriminate NAC sensitivity. Results: CTCs and CECs were related to clinicopathological characteristics. Triploid CTCs, tetraploid CTCs, and total CECs were found to be higher in incipient patients than in relapse patients (P = 0.036, P = 0.019, and P = 0.025, respectively). The number of total CECs and large cell CECs was also associated with advanced tumor stage (P = 0.028 and P = 0.033) and grade (P = 0.028 and P = 0.041). Remarkably, tumor-biomarker-positive CTCs were associated with worse OS and RFS (P = 0.026 and P = 0.038) in NMIBC patients underwent TURBT. CECs cluster was an independent predictor of recurrence in non-high-risk NMIBC patients underwent TURBT (HR = 9.21, P = 0.040). For NAC analysis, pre-NAC tetraploid CTCs and small cell CTCs demonstrated the capability in discriminating NAC-sensitive from insensitive patients. Additionally, tetraploid CTCs and single CTCs elevated post-NAC would indicate chemoresistance.

Although improvements in stroke care and outcomes have been reported in high-income countries, little is known about practice and outcomes in low and middle-income countries. We aimed to compare patterns of care available and their association with patient outcomes across countries at different economic levels. Methods We studied the patterns and effect of practice variations (ie, treatments used and access to services) among participants in the INTERSTROKE study, an international observational study that enrolled 13 447 stroke patients from 142 clinical sites in 32 countries between Jan 11, 2007, and Aug 8, 2015. We supplemented patient data with a questionnaire about health-care and stroke service facilities at all participating hospitals. Using univariate and multivariate regression analyses to account for patient casemix and service clustering, we estimated the association between services available, treatments given, and patient outcomes (death or dependency) at 1 month. Findings We obtained full information for 12 342 (92%) of 13 447 INTERSTROKE patients, from 108 hospitals in 28 countries; 2576 from 38 hospitals in ten high-income countries and 9766 from 70 hospitals in 18 low and middle-income countries. Patients in low-income and middle-income countries more often had severe strokes, intracerebral haemorrhage, poorer access to services, and used fewer investigations and treatments (p<0·0001) than those in high-income countries, although only differences in patient characteristics explained the poorer clinical outcomes in low and middle-income countries. However across all countries, irrespective of economic level, access to a stroke unit was associated with improved use of investigations and treatments, access to other rehabilitation services, and improved survival without severe dependency (odds ratio [OR] 1·29; 95% CI 1·14–1·44; all p<0·0001), which was independent of patient casemix characteristics and other measures of care. Use of acute antiplatelet treatment was associated with improved survival (1·39; 1·12–1·72) irrespective of other patient and service characteristics. Interpretation Evidence-based treatments, diagnostics, and stroke units were less commonly available or used in low and middle-income countries.

Particularly, many spatial–temporal feature extractors have been proposed, such as RNNs-based models, temporal convolutional network (TCN), and 3D convolutional neural networks (3DCNN) for modeling long-term dependencies in sequential data. However, it remains challenging to obtain a high recognition rate because of the difficulty of effectively extracting spatial–temporal features and efficiently classifying them with noisy and complex skeleton sequences. Therefore, this paper proposes a deep ensemble framework called multi-model ensemble gesture recognition network (MMEGRN) for skeleton-based hand gesture recognition. Specifically, to establish effective feature extraction and accurate gesture recognition, we propose an architecture consisting of four sub-networks, three spatio-temporal features classifiers to leverage their various capabilities of extracting and classifying skeleton sequences. Through late feature fusion, the features resulted from the feature extractors of each sub-network are fused into a new fusion classifier. Each subnetwork is trained independently to perform the task of gesture recognition using only skeleton joints. The training is performed using the cyclic annealing learning rate to generate a series of models that are combined in an ensemble using the optimized weighted ensemble (OWE) method. The proposed framework combines deep learning and ensemble strengths to establish a new deep-learning network architecture for more accurate and efficient hand gesture recognition.

Their associations, risk alleles, risk allele frequencies, odds ratios and population attributable risk scores were derived and calculated, then compared with those in the current Chinese population, including 1 194 IgAN patients and 902 controls. Using the significant variants, genetic risk scores were calculated and compared between the East Asians and the Europeans. The correlation between the genetic risk scores and clinical manifestations was also evaluated. Results There were 16 independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located in 11 loci showing significantly association with susceptibility to IgAN in the Europeans. 93.75% (15/16) of them also showed significant associations in the Chinese (P<0.05). The effects of all the associated SNPs were in the same direction, either risk or being protective for IgAN, between the Chinese and the Europeans. On the contrary, remarkable higher risk allelic odds ratio (P=1.94×10-2), higher risk allele frequency (P=3.09×10-2), and higher population attributable risk (P=3.03×10-4) were observed for most of the associated SNPs in the Chinese than in the Europeans.

However, existing architectures treat different scale features equally without considering the scale-specific characteristics, \textit{i.e.}, the within-scale characteristics are ignored in the architecture design. In this paper, we reveal this missing piece for multi-scale architecture design and accordingly propose a novel Multi-Scale Adaptive Network (MSANet) for single image denoising. Specifically, MSANet simultaneously embraces the within-scale characteristics and the cross-scale complementarity thanks to three novel neural blocks, \textit{i.e.}, adaptive feature block (AFeB), adaptive multi-scale block (AMB), and adaptive fusion block (AFuB). In brief, AFeB is designed to adaptively preserve image details and filter noises, which is highly expected for the features with mixed details and noises. AMB could enlarge the receptive field and aggregate the multi-scale information, which meets the need of contextually informative features. AFuB devotes to adaptively sampling and transferring the features from one scale to another scale, which fuses the multi-scale features with varying characteristics from coarse to fine.

Method Radiograph predictive features from 2122 Chinese Han clinical pelvic with ages ranging from 18 to 26 years were collected retrospectively to train and test the sex prediction model using deep machine learning’s convolutional neural networks (CNN). Model performance was assessed using a Chinese Han population with 361 samples and a white population with 50 samples.

Second, AirNet is free from the prior of the corruption types and levels, which just uses the observed corrupted image to perform inference. These two advantages enable AirNet to enjoy better flexibility and higher economy in real world scenarios wherein the priors on the corruptions are hard to know and the degradation will change with space and time.

In reality, the prosperity of FL is largely due to a centralized framework called FedAvg, in which workers are in charge of model training and servers are in control of model aggregation. However, FedAvg's centralized worker-server architecture has raised new concerns, be it the low scalability of the cluster, the risk of data leakage, and the failure or even defection of the central server. To overcome these problems, we propose Decentralized Federated Trusted Averaging (DeFTA), a decentralized FL framework that serves as a plug-and-play replacement for FedAvg, instantly bringing better security, scalability, and fault-tolerance to the federated learning process after installation. In principle, it fundamentally resolves the above-mentioned issues from an architectural perspective without compromises or tradeoffs, primarily consisting of a new model aggregating formula with theoretical performance analysis, and a decentralized trust system (DTS) to greatly improve system robustness. Note that since DeFTA is an alternative to FedAvg at the framework level, \textit{prevalent algorithms published for FedAvg can be also utilized in DeFTA with ease}. Extensive experiments on six datasets and six basic models suggest that DeFTA not only has comparable performance with FedAvg in a more realistic setting, but also achieves great resilience even when 66% of workers are malicious.

To address this problem, this work presents a Deep Convolutional LSTM (DConvLSTM) model to learn more discriminative spatiotemporal features from skeleton data implicitly. The model employs multi-layer ConvLSTM to accurately capture the multiscale spatial and sequential information of the gesture and preserves a fast inference and lightweight size.

Most data-driven signal diagnosis methods are based on a closed-set assumption that class sets of training and test data are the same. However, in industrial scenarios, during the running process of the device, the operating environment and condition may change over time, continuing generating data belonging to unknown classes with new characteristics and distribution. The unknown classes usually reflect new modes or faults of the device needed to be captured. They are unavailable in training phase, contradicting the closed-set assumption. Existing methods are inappropriate to this type of open-set classification, requiring to classify known classes and recognize unknown classes. To address this challenging problem, this article proposes a generic open-set signal classification method. First, we apply Fourier transform to convert the sensor signals from time domain to frequency domain, then data in the time and frequency domains are fused. Next, a variational encoder-classifier network is proposed to classify known classes and learn the distribution of feature space to extract robust latent features. Finally, based on extreme value theory and entropy, a pair of discriminators determine whether samples belong to unknown or not.

The rough hypercuboid approach is an emerging technique that can be applied to eliminate irrelevant and redundant features, especially for the inexactness problem in approximate numerical classification. By integrating the meta-heuristic-based evolutionary search technique, a novel global search method for numerical feature selection is proposed in this article based on the hybridization of the rough hypercuboid approach and binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO) algorithm, namely RH-BPSO. To further alleviate the issue of high computational cost when processing large-scale datasets, parallelization approaches for calculating the hybrid feature evaluation criteria are presented by decomposing and recombining hypercuboid equivalence partition matrix via horizontal data partitioning. A distributed meta-heuristic optimized rough hypercuboid feature selection (DiRH-BPSO) algorithm is thus developed and embedded in the Apache Spark cloud computing model. Extensive experimental results indicate that RH-BPSO is promising and can significantly outperform the other representative feature selection algorithms in terms of classification accuracy, the cardinality of the selected feature subset, and execution efficiency. Moreover, experiments on distributed-memory multicore clusters show that DiRH-BPSO is significantly faster than its sequential counterpart and is perfectly capable of completing large-scale feature selection tasks that fail on a single node due to memory constraints.

A typical and well-performed strategy is gradient-based methods (i.e., Differentiable Architecture Search (DARTS)), which mainly searches the target sparse child graph from a trainable dense super graph. However, during the searching phrase, training the dense super graph usually requires excessively computational resources. Besides, the training based on a dense graph is excessively inefficient, and the memory consumption is prohibitively high. To alleviate this shortcoming, recently Iterative Shrinkage Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA), a sparse coding recovery algorithm, has been applied to DARTS, which directly optimizes the compressed representation of the super graph, and saves the memory and time consumption. Indeed, there are several such kinds of sparse coding recovery algorithms, and ISTA is not the best one in terms of recovery efficiency and effectiveness. To investigate the impact of different sparse coding recovery algorithm on performance in DARTS and provide some insights. Firstly, we design several sparse DARTS based on different sparse coding recovery algorithms (i.e., LISTA, CoD, and Lars). Then a series of controlled experiments on selected algorithms are conducted. The accuracy, search time and other indicators of the model are collected and compared. Sufficient theoretical analysis and experimental exploration reveal that the different compression algorithms show different characteristics on the sparse DARTS. Specifically, Lars-NAS tends to choose the operation with fewer parameters, while Cod-NAS is the simplest of the four recovery algorithms, and its consuming time is very short, but the CoD-NAS model is unstable. Particularly, LISTA-NAS achieves the accurate results with stable recovery time. Thus, it can be seen that all compression algorithms are available to utilized according to different environments and requirements.", "author": "Hu, Yanqing and Ye, Qing and Fu, Huan and Lv, Jiancheng", "booktitle": "Proceedings of the 8th International Conference on Computing and Artificial Intelligence", "pages": "76--82", "year": "2022"}

We are aiming to develop a 2D/3D integrated network which can fully utilize both 2D and 3D information for better prediction. Methods: Our model simultaneously took 2D images and 3D images as input. 2D convolutional neural networks were used to extract 2D image features and 3D image features slice by slice. Then the model learned to compare 2D images with each 3D slice in pairs. The feature difference was calculated by incorporating 2D information to all slices in 3D images. We believe that the feature difference between 2D images and other slices can compensate for the lack of spatial depth variation in 2D images. In the prediction stage, the classification results based on 2D image features will be corrected based on feature difference. Results: Validating on the test set of the breast tumor dataset, we achieved higher quality of classification that sensitivity is 0.647 and specificity is 0.741 which is more balanced than either pure 2D or 3D model. Furthermore, our model can obtain more accurate classification accuracy of 0.705 and AUC of 0.739, while the quantity of parameters is only 20.53% of that of 3D model. Conclusion: In this study, we proposed a 2D/3D integrated network for benign–malignant breast tumor classification. This model simultaneously extracts 2D and 3D spatial contexts information which is described by feature difference between slices. Compared to 2D or 3D based models, the model has superior classification performance: more balanced sensitivity and specificity, higher accuracy and AUC, and less computational cost.

In this paper, we formulate a novel model to simultaneously learn a robust structured similarity graph and perform multi-view clustering.

Consequently, the label to each data sample can be directly assigned without any postprocessing. As a result, our model aims at accomplishing three subtasks: latent representation extraction, similarity graph learning, and cluster label allocation, in a unified framework.

Neural networks are one popular method for classifying imbalanced data. However, data imbalance often negatively affects neural networks. This problem is exacerbated when data are highly imbalanced. Existing neural network approaches for handling this problem heavily rely on rebalancing or reweighting known data. Essentially, these strategies focus on recovering the characteristics of balanced data. However, due to the serious lack of positive samples, the problem of insufficient empirical representation has not been thoroughly considered. Therefore, to solve the problem of highly imbalanced data, we explore the characteristics of the gradient norm in gradient descent optimization. We find that the key indicator of balanced data is that the gradient norms of positive and negative classes are approximately equal. Specifically, neural networks can classify known data that is highly imbalanced by considering the unit gradient direction of positive and negative classes. Furthermore, a local boundary expansion strategy is considered to alleviate the insufficient empirical representation problem of the positive class.

Specifically, MPFD-GAN mainly includes two core modules: the feature retention module and the texture reconstruction module (TRM). The former can capture non-local similar features by full advantage of the different receptive fields, which facilitates the network to recover the complete structure. The latter adopts a supervisory attention mechanism that fully utilizes the recovered low-scale face to refine incoming features at every scale before propagating them further. Moreover, TRM extracts the high-frequency texture information from the recovered low-scale face by the Laplace operator, which guides subsequent steps to progressively recover faithful face texture details.

In this article, instead of merely considering the sparsity of diversity within a graph as previous methods do, we incline to a more suitable consideration that the diversity should be sparse across graphs. It is intuitive that the divergent parts are supposed to be inconsistent with each other, otherwise it would contradict the definition of diversity.

This will inevitably cause the high-performance workers to waste time waiting for the weak computational workers, which in turn results in the inefficiency of the cluster. In this paper, we propose a Dynamic Load Balance (DLB) strategy for the distributed training of DNNs to tackle this issue. Specifically, the performance of each worker is evaluated first based on the performance demonstration during the previous training epochs, and then the batch size and dataset partition are adaptively adjusted in consideration of the current performance of the workers. As a result, the waiting cost among the workers will be eliminated, thereby the utilization of the clusters is highly improved. Furthermore, the essential theoretical analysis has also been provided to justify the convergence of the proposed algorithm. Extensive experiments have been conducted on the CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 benchmark datasets with four state-of-the-art DNN models. The experimental results indicate that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve the utilization of the distributed cluster. In addition, the proposed algorithm can also prevent the load imbalance of the distributed DNN training from being affected by the disturbance and can be employed flexibly in conjunction with the other synchronous distributed DNN training methods.", "author": "Ye, Qing and Zhou, Yuhao and Shi, Mingjia and Sun, Yanan and Lv, Jiancheng", "journal": "IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computational Intelligence", "volume": "7", "number": "4", "pages": "1217--1227", "year": "2022", "publisher": "IEEE"}

Design/methodology/approach Based on the game theory and Hotelling model, the authors formulate a new model to study the equilibrium of different buyback models, given the utility maximization of the consumers, the profit maximization and the constraint on nondecreasing market share of the enterprises, and the authors conduct comparative analysis. Findings Intuitively, enterprises buying back products of other brands would appeal to some consumers. However, the authors find that after implementing the multibuyback scheme, enterprises may not be able to seize competitors' markets or even lose their original customer base in the context considered in this article counterintuitive. In addition, the size of remaining market share and the consumer's multichannel psychological acquisition affect the choice of buyback promotion strategies. Moreover, after implementing multibuyback scheme, customers with old products subsidize those who receive additional discounts. Finally, the authors point out that the buyback strategy choices of companies with different goal-oriented are diverse. Practical implications This study has a very solid realistic background and provides guidance for enterprises to implement buyback promotion strategies. In addition, the authors unearth new influencing factors to provide a reasonable explanation for different buyback strategies in reality.

Artificial intelligence (AI) training in some chess games can be bottlenecked by the imbalance of opening moves, making it challenging to improve chess strength. The first-move balance problem can be explored to achieve a balanced win rate in chess games. This study uses Go-Moku as an example to explore the first-move balance point problem for different sizes of Go-Moku boards. We design a self-playing Go-Moku intelligence algorithm using deep reinforcement learning and Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS), which can considerably save arithmetic power without affecting the strength of the AI. To address the characteristics of Go-Moku and its complexity, we propose an algorithm using dynamic MCTS simulation counts, which only employs a reasonable amount of hyperparameters to achieve better performance with the cost of a relatively small number of simulations. By symmetrically expanding the data and optimizing the exploration and selection allocation, the training efficiency of the Go-Moku AI is improved through Multiple Process Interface (MPI) multi-processes. Building the test model of first-move balance points for a universal Go-Moku board, we obtain a set of first-move balance points for different board sizes. The first-move balance point of Go-Moku that makes the game even is found by simulating the game win rate for all first-move drop points. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve world-leading chess strength in Gomocup by engine play tests and can find the first-move balance point of Go-Moku on boards of various sizes. The results of this study will help optimize the rule setting of Go-Moku and improve the training efficiency of AI in the field of Go-Moku, which can be extended to the exploration of balance in other chess games.", "author": "Liu, Pengsen and Zhou, Jizhe and Lv, Jiancheng", "journal": "Knowledge-Based Systems", "volume": "261", "pages": "110207", "year": "2023", "publisher": "Elsevier"}

In the first stage, the face-parsing network is fine-tuned to obtain semantic facial region information. In the second stage, a generator consisting of SNBlock, CF_ShiftBlocks, and CF_MergeBlock, which ensures that high-quality pluralistic face results are generated, is used. Specifically, CF_ShiftBlocks completes pluralistic face generation by transforming the attribute information from the conditional face extracted by the attribute extractor and ensuring the consistency of the attribute information between the conditional and generated faces. CF_MergeBlock ensures structural consistency between the masked and background regions of the generated face using facial region semantic information.

We develop a game-theoretical model to study the interactions between dishonest entrepreneurs, pivotal backers, and platform regulations. We find that entrepreneurs tend to exaggerate quality because it increases their profits and the feasible set of crowdfunding projects. Under the platform regulation, entrepreneurs can claim quality as high as an unpunished level. Specifically, when the product development success rate is relatively high, regulations can decrease entrepreneurs’ profits and increase backer surplus. However, for projects with a relatively low success rate, regulating with penalties only does not work. Moreover, we extend our model to an interesting scenario and find that the combined use of penalties and deferred payment mechanisms can reduce the level of quality overstatement further.

To address this problem, we propose DSARA to automatically search for the neural architectures that are accurate and robust after adversarial training. In particular, we design a novel cell-based search space specially for adversarial training, which improves the accuracy and the robustness upper bound of the searched architectures by carefully designing the placement of the cells and the proportional relationship of the filter numbers. Then we propose a two-stage search strategy to search for both accurate and robust neural architectures.

At the second stage, the architecture parameters are optimized to minimize both the natural loss and the adversarial loss utilizing the proposed multi-objective adversarial training method, so that the searched neural architectures are both accurate and robust. We evaluate the proposed algorithm under natural data and various adversarial attacks, which reveals the superiority of the proposed method in terms of both accurate and robust architectures.

Therefore, we propose a new solution for neural networks classifying imbalanced data by sampling absent minority class samples. Specifically, an improved Metropolis Hasting (IMH) algorithm is developed to sample absent minority class samples by collecting samples rejected by the majority class approximation process. The sampled absent minority samples are then provided to neural networks to address the data imbalance problem. For IMH, in order to accelerate the sampling process and reduce the vague class definition of the sampled minority class samples, line segment transition kernel and class probability constraint are proposed. For neural networks, two boundary shifting strategies are supported to operate on different application modes of sampled absent minority class samples. In experiments, the proposed method is validated on 34 imbalanced datasets. Comparable AUC, G-MEAN, and MACC results are achieved.

One of the classic models for dealing with imbalanced data is neural networks. However, the data imbalance problem often causes the neural network to display negative class preference behavior. Using an undersampling strategy to reconstruct a balanced dataset is one of the methods to alleviate the data imbalance problem. However, most existing undersampling methods focus more on the data or aim to preserve the overall structural characteristics of the negative class through potential energy estimation, while the problems of gradient inundation and insufficient empirical representation of positive samples have not been well considered. Therefore, a new paradigm for solving the data imbalance problem is proposed. Specifically, to solve the problem of gradient inundation, an informative undersampling strategy is derived from the performance degradation and used to restore the ability of neural networks to work under imbalanced data.

First, they adopt a siamese dual-encoder architecture to encode queries and documents independently for fast indexing and searching, while neglecting the finer-grained term-wise interactions. This results in a sub-optimal recall performance. Second, their model training highly relies on a negative sampling technique to build up the negative documents in their contrastive losses. To address these challenges, we present Adversarial Retriever-Ranker (AR2), which consists of a dual-encoder retriever plus a cross-encoder ranker. The two models are jointly optimized according to a minimax adversarial objective: the retriever learns to retrieve negative documents to cheat the ranker, while the ranker learns to rank a collection of candidates including both the ground-truth and the retrieved ones, as well as providing progressive direct feedback to the dual-encoder retriever. Through this adversarial game, the retriever gradually produces harder negative documents to train a better ranker, whereas the cross-encoder ranker provides progressive feedback to improve retriever. We evaluate AR2 on three benchmarks. Experimental results show that AR2 consistently and significantly outperforms existing dense retriever methods and achieves new state-of-the-art results on all of them.

We develop a stylized game-theoretic signaling model that captures the impacts of information asymmetry on entrepreneurs’crowdfunding decisions and whether deferred payments can encourage entrepreneurs to produce innovative products. Our results demonstrate that information asymmetry will stymie product innovation and the entrepreneur may utilize various campaign design parameters to signal her product type. While proportional based deferred payments can lower the signaling cost, they bring more financial pressure on entrepreneurs, which impedes entrepreneurs’ motivation to innovate. Crowdfunding platforms can motivate entrepreneurs to manufacture innovative products by setting an appropriate reserved percentage. Furthermore, target based deferred payments can always encourage entrepreneurs to produce innovative products since they can reduce the signaling cost without increasing the financing pressure.

Currently, many gradient compression methods (e.g., Sparsification, Quantization, Low-Rank) have been proposed to optimize the transmission process. Since each layer needs to be processed and compressed respectively before transmission, a rash of time-consuming tensor operations is demanded. To alleviate this issue, we propose a layer-based sparsification method, which stems from the observation that the learning efficiency and convergence speed of different layers of DNN is different during the training process. Instead of compressing all gradients in an iteration, some layers are preferentially selected using a well-designed sliding window, which largely avoids unnecessary tensor operations. The sliding window is adjusted according to the dynamic characteristics of the parameter during the DNN training. Extensive experiments on one Text task and two Image Classification tasks are conducted to validate the efficiency of the proposed method in the same environment configuration, where the gradient compression adopts the layer-based sparsification and the other three comparative state-of-the-art methods. The total training time, communication time, and model accuracy are collected and analyzed. Sufficient experimental results demonstrate that both training and communication time can be greatly reduced, which is especially up to 60% in some cases. Additionally, despite slightly decreased within 1% model quality, the results indicate that the improvement in throughput can be as high as 50%.", "author": "Hu, Yanqing and Ye, Qing and Zhang, Zhongyu and Lv, Jiancheng", "booktitle": "2022 IEEE 24th Int Conf on High Performance Computing \\& Communications; 8th Int Conf on Data Science \\& Systems; 20th Int Conf on Smart City; 8th Int Conf on Dependability in Sensor, Cloud \\& Big Data Systems \\& Application (HPCC/DSS/SmartCity/DependSys)", "pages": "1342--1349", "year": "2022", "organization": "IEEE"}

Besides, due to high data collection and annotation costs, no large-scale labeled datasets are available. As a result, existing methods commonly use single-view CXR with annotations to activate bone. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose an adaptive bone activation framework. This framework leverages the Dual-Energy Subtraction (DES) images to consist of multi-view image pairs of the CXR and the contrastive learning theory to construct training samples. In particular, we first devise a Siamese/Triplet architecture supervisor; correspondingly, we establish a cGAN-styled activator based on the learned skeletal information to generate the bone image from the CXR. To our knowledge, the proposed method is the first multi-view bone activation framework obtained without manual annotation and has more robust adaptability. The mean of Relative Mean Absolute Error () and the Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) are 3.45% and 1.12 respectively, which proves the results activated by our method retain more skeletal details with few feature distribution changes.

AI methods applied in flue gas desulfurization can be usually divided into two stages: modeling and optimization. In the modeling stage, data-driven methods are often used to build the system model or rule base; In the optimization stage, heuristic search or reinforcement learning methods can be applied to find the optimal operating parameters based on the constructed model or rule base. AI methods, including data-driven and knowledge-driven algorithms, are widely used in the abnormal condition warning.

Genetic programming (GP) has been the dominator in solving SR problems. However, as the scale of SR problems increases, GP often poorly demonstrates and cannot effectively address the real-world high-dimensional problems. This limitation is mainly caused by the stochastic evolutionary nature of traditional GP in constructing the trees. In this paper, we propose a differentiable approach named DGP to construct GP trees towards high-dimensional SR for the first time. Specifically, a new data structure called differentiable symbolic tree is proposed to relax the discrete structure to be continuous, thus a gradient-based optimizer can be presented for the efficient optimization. In addition, a sampling method is proposed to eliminate the discrepancy caused by the above relaxation for valid symbolic expressions. Furthermore, a diversification mechanism is introduced to promote the optimizer escaping from local optima for globally better solutions. With these designs, the proposed DGP method can efficiently search for the GP trees with higher performance, thus being capable of dealing with high-dimensional SR. To demonstrate the effectiveness of DGP, we conducted various experiments against the state of the arts based on both GP and deep neural networks. The experiment results reveal that DGP can outperform these chosen peer competitors on high-dimensional regression benchmarks with dimensions varying from tens to thousands. In addition, on the synthetic SR problems, the proposed DGP method can also achieve the best recovery rate even with different noisy levels.

Such a coarse-to-fine paradigm is implemented through two neural blocks, i.e., condensed attention neural block (CA) and dual adaptive neural block (DA). In brief, CA employs feature aggregation, attention computation, and feature recovery to efficiently capture the global dependency at the superpixel level.

Among them, deep learning-based hashing achieves better performance on large-scale data due to its excellent extraction and representation ability for nonlinear heterogeneous features. However, there are still two main challenges in catastrophic forgetting when data with new categories arrive continuously, and time-consuming for non-continuous hashing retrieval to retrain for updating. To this end, we, in this paper, propose a novel deep lifelong cross-modal hashing to achieve lifelong hashing retrieval instead of re-training hash function repeatedly when new data arrive. Specifically, we design lifelong learning strategy to update hash functions by directly training the incremental data instead of retraining new hash functions using all the accumulated data, which significantly reduce training time. Then, we propose lifelong hashing loss to enable original hash codes participate in lifelong learning but remain invariant, and further preserve the similarity and dis-similarity among original and incremental hash codes to maintain performance. Additionally, considering distribution heterogeneity when new data arriving continuously, we introduce enhanced-semantic similarity to supervise hash learning, and it has been proven that the similarity improves performance with detailed analysis.

Here, we focus on a more general case, selective image translation (SLIT), under an unsupervised setting. SLIT essentially operates through a shunt mechanism that involves learning gates to manipulate only the contents of interest (CoIs), which can be either local or global, while leaving the irrelevant parts unchanged. Existing methods typically rely on a flawed implicit assumption that CoIs are separable at arbitrary levels, ignoring the entangled nature of DNN representations. This leads to unwanted changes and learning inefficiency. In this work, we revisit SLIT from an information-theoretical perspective and introduce a novel framework, which equips two opposite forces to disentangle the visual features. One force encourages independence between spatial locations on the features, while the other force unites multiple locations to form a “block” that jointly characterizes an instance or attribute that a single location may not independently characterize. Importantly, this disentanglement paradigm can be applied to visual features of any layer, enabling shunting at arbitrary feature levels, which is a significant advantage not explored in existing works.

This paper proposes a novel integrated framework and a denoising method for low-dose medical CT images to obtain a better denoising effect whilst at the same time preserving an image’s local structure information. First, an image moving decomposition is employed to decompose the CT image. The original CT noisy image is decomposed, and the components will be processed separately, so that the details and edges of the CT image can be better preserved. Next, the Shearlet Transformation-based denoising method is applied to the component which contains edges and detailed information of the CT image. The multi-directionality and multi-scale property of the Shearlet make it possible to obtain better effect in denoising the detail parts. BM3D filtering is used to remove noise in the component similar to the origin image, and obtain ideal denoising results in denoising the approximate components (mainly low frequency part) of the CT image. With the two processed components and the inverse decomposition, the denoised image is obtained. Finally, simulations and clinical experiments are conducted and comparisons made.

However, FCCU often encounters various abnormal operating conditions, leading to safety hazards, downtime, and reduced production efficiency. Early warning of these abnormal conditions is crucial but challenging due to high noise, strong hysteresis, and class imbalance problems. To tackle these challenges, a novel and universal attention-based framework called AEW-AOC (Attention-based Early Warning for Abnormal Operating Conditions) is specifically designed for FCCU applications. The proposed AEW-AOC framework incorporates three key components: (1) a Self-Correlation Denoiser (SCD) module is proposed to exploit spatiotemporal data correlation to effectively reduce noise; (2) a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (Conv-LSTM) module is employed to address the issue of strong hysteresis by capturing temporal variation features of process parameters; (3) an Anomaly Pattern Attention (APA) module is proposed to enhance the distinguishability of abnormal operating conditions based on clustering results from historical abnormal instances. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed AEW-AOC framework, particularly in practical applications. Specifically, the AEW-AOC framework obtains an impressive fB score of 91.00% on LIC201, 90.45% on LIC202, and 90.64% on LIC801.

As the role of protein methylation in tumorigenesis and development becomes clearer, the role of lysine N-methyltransferase SET domain containing 7 (SETD7) in the progression and immune escape of BCa is worth studying.Methods: The correlation between lysine methyltransferase family and prognosis or immunotheray sensitivity of BCa patients were analyzed, and SETD7 was screened out because of the significant correlation between its expression and survival data or immunotherapy sensitivity. The expression of SETD7 in BCa tissues and cell lines were explored. The functions of SETD7 were investigated by proliferation and migration assays. The role of SETD7 in BCa immune escape was validated by analyzing the correlation between SETD7 expression and tumor microenvironment (TME)-related indicators. The results were further confirmed by conducting BCa cell-CD8+ T cell co-culture assays and tumorigenesis experiment in human immune reconstitution NOG mice (HuNOG mice).

Hence it leads to high storage consumption, especially for multi-view datasets. In this paper, we address this limitation by introducing a lifelong multi-view clustering framework. Our approach uses view specific knowledge libraries to capture intra-view knowledge across different tasks. Specifically, we propose two types of libraries: an Orthogonal Basis Library that stores cluster centers in consecutive tasks, and a Feature Embedding Library that embeds feature relations shared among correlated tasks. When a new clustering task is coming, the knowledge is iteratively transferred from libraries to encode the new task, and knowledge libraries are updated according to the online update formulation.

The latter mitigates oscillation caused by mixed precision training, promoting smoother training and faster model convergence. Extensive experiments on VOC and COCO datasets demonstrate that MPQ-YOLO achieves a good trade-off between model compression and detection performance. Specifically, compared to the full-precision model, MPQ-YOLO achieves compression of up to 16.3x and 14.2x in terms of computational complexity and model size, respectively, while maintaining relatively high detection accuracy, i.e., 74.7% on VOC and 51.5% on COCO. To the best of our knowledge, MPQ-YOLO is the first YOLO framework with dual low mixed-precision quantization. Moreover, compared to the existing layer-wise mixed-precision quantization methods which cause redundant data processing and massive data movement, MPQ-YOLO offers a more hardware-designer-friendly and straightforward solution through efficient resource utilization and reuse.", "author": "Liu, Xinyu and Wang, Tao and Yang, Jiaming and Tang, Chenwei and Lv, Jiancheng", "journal": "Neurocomputing", "volume": "574", "pages": "127210", "year": "2024", "publisher": "Elsevier"}

However, intricate industrial milieus, particularly those relating to energy exploration and production, frequently encompass data characterized by long-tailed class distribution, sample imbalance, and domain shift. These attributes pose noteworthy challenges to data-centric Deep Learning (DL) techniques, crucial for the realization of industrial intelligence. The present study centers on the intricate and distinctive industrial scenarios of Nuclear Power Generation (NPG), meticulously scrutinizing the application of DL techniques under the constraints of finite data samples. Initially, the paper expounds on potential employment scenarios for AI across the full life-cycle of NPG. Subsequently, we delve into an evaluative exposition of DL's advancement, grounded in the finite sample perspective. This encompasses aspects such as small-sample learning, few-shot learning, zero-shot learning, and open-set recognition, also referring to the unique data characteristics of NPG. The paper then proceeds to present two specific case studies. The first revolves around the automatic recognition of zirconium alloy metallography, while the second pertains to open-set recognition for signal diagnosis of machinery sensors. These cases, spanning the entirety of NPG's life-cycle, are accompanied by constructive outcomes and insightful deliberations.

In this paper, we present a novel RatSLAM system by using more complex semantic object information for loop closure detection (LCD) and experience map building, inspired by the effectiveness of semantic information for scene recognition in the biological brain. Specifically, we calculate the similarity between current and previous scenes in LCD based on the pixel information computed by the sum of absolute differences (SAD) and the semantic information extracted by the YOLOv2 network. Then we build an enhanced experience map with object-level information, where the 3D model segmentation technology is used to perform instance semantic segmentation on the recognized objects.

To shed light on this debate, we developed a novel static-temporal multiplex network characterizing both the regular (static) and random (temporal) contact patterns of individuals and a SARS-CoV-2 transmission model calibrated with historical COVID-19 epidemiological data. We estimated that the TTI strategy alone could not control the disease spread: assuming R0 = 2.5, the infection attack rate would be reduced by 24.5%. Increased test capacity and improved contact trace efficiency only slightly improved the effectiveness of the TTI. We thus investigated the effectiveness of the TTI strategy when coupled with reactive social distancing policies. Limiting contacts on the temporal contact layer would be insufficient to control an epidemic and contacts on both layers would need to be limited simultaneously. For example, the infection attack rate would be reduced by 68.1% when the reactive distancing policy disconnects 30% and 50% of contacts on static and temporal layers, respectively.

Nevertheless, the abundant external knowledge such as semantic descriptions, which naturally conduces to clustering, is regrettably overlooked. In this work, we propose leveraging external knowledge as a new supervision signal to guide clustering, even though it seems irrelevant to the given data.

The key to secure resilience against Byzantine machines in distributed learning is resilient aggregation mechanisms. Although abundant resilient aggregation rules have been proposed, they are designed in ad-hoc manners, imposing extra barriers on comparing, analyzing, and improving the rules across performance criteria. This paper studies near-optimal aggregation rules using clustering in the presence of outliers. Our outlier-robust clustering approach utilizes geometric properties of the update vectors provided by workers. Our analysis show that constant approximations to the 1-center and 1-mean clustering problems with outliers provide near-optimal resilient aggregators for metric-based criteria, which have been proven to be crucial in the homogeneous and heterogeneous cases respectively. In addition, we discuss two contradicting types of attacks under which no single aggregation rule is guaranteed to improve upon the naive average. Based on the discussion, we propose a two-phase resilient aggregation framework. We run experiments for image classification using a non-convex loss function.

However, FCCU often encounters various abnormal operating conditions, leading to safety hazards, downtime, and reduced production efficiency. Early warning of these abnormal conditions is crucial but challenging due to high noise, strong hysteresis, and class imbalance problems. To tackle these challenges, a novel and universal attention-based framework called AEW-AOC (Attention-based Early Warning for Abnormal Operating Conditions) is specifically designed for FCCU applications. The proposed AEW-AOC framework incorporates three key components: (1) a Self-Correlation Denoiser (SCD) module is proposed to exploit spatiotemporal data correlation to effectively reduce noise; (2) a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (Conv-LSTM) module is employed to address the issue of strong hysteresis by capturing temporal variation features of process parameters; (3) an Anomaly Pattern Attention (APA) module is proposed to enhance the distinguishability of abnormal operating conditions based on clustering results from historical abnormal instances. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed AEW-AOC framework, particularly in practical applications. Specifically, the AEW-AOC framework obtains an impressive fb score of 91.00% on LIC201, 90.45% on LIC202, and 90.64% on LIC801.

To this end, various methods have been proposed to create an adaptive filter by incorporating an extra filter (e.g., a high-pass filter) extracted from the graph topology. However, these methods heavily rely on topological information and ignore the node attribute space, which severely sacrifices the expressive power of the deep GCNs, especially when dealing with disassortative graphs. In this paper, we propose a cross-space adaptive filter, called CSF, to produce the adaptive-frequency information extracted from both the topology and attribute spaces. Specifically, we first derive a tailored attribute-based high-pass filter that can be interpreted theoretically as a minimizer for semi-supervised kernel ridge regression. Then, we cast the topology-based low-pass filter as a Mercer's kernel within the context of GCNs. This serves as a foundation for combining it with the attribute-based filter to capture the adaptive-frequency information.

This helps to address the over-smoothing problem while maintaining effectiveness.

Despite their successes, conventional neural-based DRL models are criticized for low energy efficiency, making them laborious to be widely applied in low-power electronics. With more biologically plausible plasticity principles, spiking neural networks (SNNs) are now considered an energy-efficient and robust alternative. The most existing dynamics and learning paradigms for spiking neurons with a common Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron model often result in relatively low efficiency and poor robustness. To address these limitations, we propose a multi-attribute dynamic attenuation learning improved spiking actor network (MADA-SAN) for reinforcement learning to achieve effective decision-making. The resistance, membrane voltage and membrane current of spiking neurons are updated from a fixed value into dynamic attenuation. By enhancing the temporal relation dependencies in neurons, this model can learn the spatio-temporal relevance of complex continuous information well. Extensive experimental results show MADA-SAN performs better than its counterpart deep actor network on six continuous control tasks from OpenAI gym.

Methods A retrospective analysis was performed in a cohort of patients with crescentic IgAN from January 2012 to September 2020 at 9 sites across China. Clinical and pathological data, as well as therapeutic regimens, were collected. In order to minimize the effect of potential confounders in baseline characteristics, propensity score matching using a 1 ∶1 ratio nearest neighbor algorithm was performed between the adjunctive plasma exchange therapy group and the intensive immunosuppressive therapy group. The primary outcome was end-stage of kidney disease (ESKD). Kaplan-Meier method was used to compare the difference in renal survival between the two groups. Results A total of 95 crescentic IgAN patients with acute kidney disease were included in this study, including 37 (38.9%) patients receiving adjunctive plasma exchange therapy, and 58 (61.1%) patients receiving intensive immunosuppressive therapy. In the whole cohort, the baseline eGFR was 12.77 (7.28, 21.29) mL/(min·1.73 m2), 24-hour urinary protein quantification was 5.9 (4.0, 8.9) g, and crescent percentage was 64.71% (54.55%, 73.68%).

In this paper, we propose a novel scheme to inject personalized prior knowledge into the global model in each client, which attempts to mitigate the introduced incomplete information problem in PFL.

In the present study, we found that low expression of METTL16 predicted poor survival in BLCA patients. METTL16 inhibited the proliferation and cisplatin-resistance function of bladder cancer cells in vitro and in vivo. In addition, METTL16 reduced the mRNA stability of prostate transmembrane protein androgen induced-1 (PMEPA1) via binding to its m6A site in the 3'-UTR, thereby inhibited the proliferation of bladder cancer cells and increased the sensitivity of cisplatin through PMEPA1-mediated autophagy pathway.

However, annotating data for novel aerial object classes is expensive since it is time-consuming and may require expert knowledge. Thus, it is desirable to study label-efficient object detection methods on aerial images. In this work, we propose a zero-shot method for aerial object detection named visual Description Regularization, or DescReg. Concretely, we identify the weak semantic-visual correlation of the aerial objects and aim to address the challenge with prior descriptions of their visual appearance. Instead of directly encoding the descriptions into class embedding space which suffers from the representation gap problem, we propose to infuse the prior inter-class visual similarity conveyed in the descriptions into the embedding learning. The infusion process is accomplished with a newly designed similarity-aware triplet loss which incorporates structured regularization on the representation space. We conduct extensive experiments with three challenging aerial object detection datasets, including DIOR, xView, and DOTA. The results demonstrate that DescReg significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art ZSD methods with complex projection designs and generative frameworks, e.g., DescReg outperforms best reported ZSD method on DIOR by 4.5 mAP on unseen classes and 8.1 in HM.

In practice, however, the correspondence of some pairs would be inevitably contaminated during data collection or annotation, thus leading to the so-called Noisy Correspondence (NC) problem. To alleviate the influence of NC, we propose a novel method termed Consistency REfining And Mining (CREAM) by revealing and exploiting the difference between correspondence and consistency. Specifically, the correspondence and the consistency only be coincident for true positive and true negative pairs, while being distinct for false positive and false negative pairs. Based on the observation, CREAM employs a collaborative learning paradigm to detect and rectify the correspondence of positives, and a negative mining approach to explore and utilize the consistency. Thanks to the consistency refining and mining strategy of CREAM, the overfitting on the false positives could be prevented and the consistency rooted in the false negatives could be exploited, thus leading to a robust CMR method.

For the grouping of network layers, we propose a grouping algorithm based on the similarity of data numerical distribution. Then, the network layers divided into the same group will be quantified using the same common scale factor to reduce the computational consumption. Considering the additional performance loss caused by sharing scale factors among multiple layers, we propose a training algorithm to optimize these shared scale factors and model parameters, by designing a learnable power-of-two scaling parameter for each layer.

Prompt learning, a recent development in the field of natural language processing, emerges as a potential solution to address this challenge. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of prompt learning in code intelligence tasks. We unveil its reliance on manually designed prompts, which often require significant human effort and expertise. Moreover, we discover existing automatic prompt design methods are very limited to code intelligence tasks due to factors including gradient dependence, high computational demands, and limited applicability. To effectively address both issues, we propose Genetic Auto Prompt (GenAP), which utilizes an elaborate genetic algorithm to automatically design prompts.

GenAP operates without the need for gradients or additional computational costs, rendering it gradient-free and cost-effective. Moreover, GenAP supports both understanding and generation types of code intelligence tasks, exhibiting great applicability. We conduct GenAP on three popular code intelligence PLMs with three canonical code intelligence tasks including defect prediction, code summarization, and code translation. The results suggest that GenAP can effectively automate the process of designing prompts.

However, successful legal case matching requires the tacit knowledge of legal practitioners, which is difficult to verbalize and encode into machines. This emphasizes the crucial role of involving legal practitioners in high-stakes legal case matching. To address this, we propose a collaborative matching framework called Co-Matching, which encourages both the machine and the legal practitioner to participate in the matching process, integrating tacit knowledge. Unlike existing methods that rely solely on the machine, Co-Matching allows both the legal practitioner and the machine to determine key sentences and then combine them probabilistically. Co-Matching introduces a method called ProtoEM to estimate human decision uncertainty, facilitating the probabilistic combination. Experimental results demonstrate that Co-Matching consistently outperforms existing legal case matching methods, delivering significant performance improvements over human- and machine-based matching in isolation (on average, +5.51% and +8.71%, respectively). Further analysis shows that Co-Matching also ensures better human-machine collaboration effectiveness.

However, these methods mainly focus on selecting informative data for expert annotations to improve the model predictive ability (i.e., triage-to-human data), while the rest of the data is indiscriminately assigned to model annotation (i.e., triage-to-model data). This may lead to inefficiencies in budget allocation for annotations, as easy data that the model could accurately annotate may be unnecessarily assigned to the expert, and hard data may be misclassified by the model. As a result, the overall annotation quality may be compromised. To address this issue, we propose a selective annotation framework called SANT.

As such, informative or hard data is assigned to the expert for annotation, while easy data is handled by the model.

The clustering results of most MKC methods are highly sensitive to the quality of the constructed kernels, as traditional methods independently compute kernel matrices for each view without fully considering complementary information across views. In previous contrastive multi-view kernel learning, the goal was to bring cross-view instances of the same sample closer during the kernel construction process while pushing apart instances across samples to achieve a comprehensive integration of cross-view information. However, its inherent drawback is the potential inappropriate amplification of distances between different instances of the same clusters (i.e., false negative pairs) during the training process, leading to a reduction in inter-class discriminability. To address this challenge, we propose a Robust Contrastive multi-view kernel Learning approach (R-CMK) against false negative pairs. It partitions negative pairs into different intervals based on distance or similarity, and for false negative pairs, reverses their optimization gradient. This effectively avoids further amplification of distances for false negative pairs while simultaneously pushing true negative pairs farther apart. We conducted comprehensive experiments on various MKC methods to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

In this study, the effect of the acrosome reaction on the efficiency of spermatozoa carrying exogenous DNA was evaluated. The results showed that the efficiency of the acrosome reaction was significantly higher (p<0.05) after incubation with 50 μmol/L progesterone compared to incubation without progesterone. It was significantly higher (p<0.05) in the 20, 40, and 60 min of progesterone treatment groups than in the 0 min treatment group.

We investigated the possible effects of introducing hybrid ¹⁸F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (¹⁸F-FDG PET)/MRI into the decision algorithm for patients with lesioned and nonlesioned drug-resistant epilepsy. Methods Three databases were searched from January 1990 to October 2022. We registered the protocol with International Platform of Registered Systematic Review and Meta-analysis Protocols. Studies in which ¹⁸F-FDG PET/MRI was conducted with ≥12 months of postsurgical follow-up in patients with refractory epilepsy. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to calculate the proportion of patients with good outcomes. Metaregression was used to investigate sources of heterogeneity. Results We identified 8105 studies, of which 23 (1292 patients in total) were included. The overall good postoperative outcome rate was 71% (95% confidence interval 63.6–74.9). Good outcome was associated with the location of the refractory epileptic lesion (temporal lobe or extratemporal; risk ratio 1.27 [95% confidence interval 1.01–1.52], P=0.009); Length of postoperative follow-up ≥40 months included in the same study accounted for 0.6% of the observed heterogeneity.

However, the existing NAS methods suffer from the following problem using traditional search strategies, i.e., when facing a large and complex search space, it is difficult to mine more effective architectures within a reasonable time, resulting in inferior search results. This research introduces the Generative Pre-trained Transformer NAS (GPT-NAS), an innovative approach designed to overcome the limitations which are inherent in traditional NAS strategies. This approach improves search efficiency and obtains better architectures by integrating GPT model into the search process. Specifically, we design a reconstruction strategy that utilizes the trained GPT to reorganize the architectures obtained from the search. In addition, to equip the GPT model with the design capabilities of neural architecture, we propose the use of the GPT model for training on a neural architecture dataset. For each architecture, the structural information of its previous layers is utilized to predict the next layer of structure, iteratively traversing the entire architecture. In this way, the GPT model can efficiently learn the key features required for neural architectures. Extensive experimental validation shows that our GPT-NAS approach beats both manually constructed neural architectures and automatically generated architectures by NAS. In addition, we validate the superiority of introducing the GPT model in several ways, and find that the accuracy of the neural architecture on the image dataset obtained from the search after introducing the GPT model is improved by up to about 9%.", "author": "Yu, Caiyang and Liu, Xianggen and Wang, Yifan and Liu, Yun and Feng, Wentao and Deng, Xiong and Tang, Chenwei and Lv, Jiancheng", "journal": "Big Data Mining and Analytics", "year": "2024", "publisher": "TUP"}

However, in the real world, different intersections possess differentiating characteristics such as unique vehicle distributions and traffic patterns. Most existing methods directly add neighboring intersection states to local intersections and optimize the cooperative policy network based on synthesized global features. This indirect optimization approach makes it difficult to thoroughly explore the mutual interactions among different intersection agents, preventing agents from truly learning features with cooperative awareness. To resolve these challenges, we introduce contrastive learning as representation task to the multi-intersection traffic signal control approach named CLlight for two-stage policy network updating. In the first stage, we utilize policy-based or actor-critic-based reinforcement learning methods such as A2C, SAC, and PPO to train policy networks with certain representational capabilities. In the second stage, by extracting pre- and post-masked features and reconstructing the post-masked features, the agents are encouraged to learn the similarities and differences between different intersection policies, which in turn enhances the cooperative and individual representation capabilities of the policy network. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of contrastive learning in the field of traffic signal control.

Methods The TCGA and BEST databases were used to analyze the associations between the expression of members of the MPP family and the prognosis or immunotherapy sensitivity of urothelial carcinoma patients. MPP1 was identified due to its significant association with survival and immunotherapy sensitivity. MPP1 expression in urothelial carcinoma tissues and cell lines was examined. An MPP1 overexpression vector was used to transfect urothelial carcinoma cells. The functional assays included proliferation, migration, urothelial carcinoma cell–CD8⁺ T-cell coculture, CD8⁺ T-cell chemotaxis, and tumorigenesis in human immune reconstitution NOG mice (HuNOG). Bioinformatics, co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP), mass spectrometry, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT–qPCR), and western blotting were used to validate the activity of the MPP1/USP12/CCL5 cascade.

However, these methods often require extensive labeled data for optimal performance, posing challenges and high costs in practical applications. Addressing this issue, Few-Shot Learning (FSL) is introduced. FSL aims to learn effectively from limited labeled samples and generalize well during testing. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of FSL, reviewing prominent deep learning based approaches of FSL. We define FSL through literature review in machine learning and specify the “N-way K-shot” paradigm to distinguish it from related learning challenges. Next, we classify FSL methods by analyzing the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension of neural networks. It underscores the necessity for models with abundant labeled examples and finite hypothesis space to generalize well to new and unseen instances. We categorize FSL methods into three types based on strategies to increase labeled samples or reduce hypothesis space: data augmentation, model-based methods, and algorithm-optimized approaches. Using this taxonomy, we review various methods and evaluate their strengths and weaknesses. We also present a comparison of these techniques as summarized in this paper, using benchmark datasets. Moreover, we delve into specific sub-tasks within FSL, such as applications in computer vision and robotics.

Sirtuin 4 (SIRT4), a member of the NAD⁺-dependent deacetylase and ADP-ribosyltransferase family, is involved in regulating cellular metabolism, DNA repair, and longevity, potentially influencing tumor progression and immune escape. This study aimed to elucidate the role of SIRT4 in BCa. Methods The correlation between the sirtuin family and immunotherapy sensitivity in BCa patients was analyzed via IMvigor210 data. The clinical significance and immunological role of SIRT4 across multiple cancer types were assessed by evaluating its associations with clinicopathologic features, prognosis, tumor mutation burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI), immune cell infiltration, and immune response genes across 33 datasets from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). SIRT4 expression was confirmed in BCa tissues, and its functions were examined via proliferation and migration assays. CD8⁺ T cells were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy individuals and activated with CD3 and CD28 antibodies and recombinant IL2. Coculture assays involving BCa cells and activated CD8⁺ T cells, alongside ELISA, were conducted to evaluate the immunological function of SIRT4. Results SIRT4 was positively associated with the immunotherapy response of BCa patients on the basis of IMvigor210 data. Its expression was downregulated in 11 tumor types but upregulated in 3. SIRT4 was significantly correlated with tumor stage in 2 tumor types and showed varying associations with overall survival, progression-free survival, and disease-specific survival. Additionally, SIRT4 was correlated with TMB in 10 tumor types and with MSI in 8. GSEA indicated that SIRT4 was negatively associated with the immune response in 9 tumor types, including BCa. It was positively correlated with immune cell infiltration in 2 tumor types and negatively correlated in 6. The TCGA data revealed that SIRT4 was positively associated with activated NK cell infiltration but negatively associated with M1 macrophages, neutrophils, resting NK cells, and activated memory CD4 T cells. Enrichment analyses revealed positive correlations with various chemokines, immunoinhibitors, immunostimulators, lymphocytes, MHC molecules, and MHC receptors, suggesting that SIRT4 may enhance the immune response in BCa. Further experiments confirmed that SIRT4 was downregulated in BCa tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. Inhibition of SIRT4 promoted BCa cell proliferation and migration, whereas knockdown of SIRT4 impaired the chemotaxis and tumor-killing ability of CD8⁺ T cells in the BCa tumor microenvironment.

In this study, we explore the image representation of neural architecture, describing the architecture in pixel space and using the long-range modeling capability of attention mechanisms to construct connections among pixels and extract tangible (tractable) architecture topology representation from them. Our attempt provides an efficient architecture representation for NPs, combined with today’s powerful pre-training models, showing promising prospects. Furthermore, recognizing that images alone may fall short in capturing configuration specifics, we design a corresponding text representation to provide a more accurate complement.

A significant advantage of SNNs lies in the binary information transmission through spike trains, eliminating the need for multiplication operations. However, due to the spatio-temporal nature of SNNs, direct application of traditional backpropagation (BP) training still results in significant computational costs. Meanwhile, learning methods based on unsupervised synaptic plasticity provide an alternative for training SNNs but often yield suboptimal results. Thus, efficiently training high-accuracy SNNs remains a challenge. In this article, we propose a highly efficient and biologically plausible spiking time sparse feedback (STSF) learning method. This algorithm modifies synaptic weights by incorporating a neuromodulator for global supervised learning using sparse direct feedback alignment (DFA) and local homeostasis learning with vanilla spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP). Such neuromorphic global–local learning focuses on instantaneous synaptic activity, enabling independent and simultaneous optimization of each network layer, thereby improving biological plausibility, enhancing parallelism, and reducing storage overhead. Incorporating sparse fixed random feedback connections for global error modulation, which uses selection operations instead of multiplication operations, further improves computational efficiency.

In this paper, we propose an Evolutionary Multi-objective Spiking Neural Architecture Search (EMO-SNAS) method that completely enables the automatic design of SNN architectures with both high performance and low power consumption. To achieve this, we first design a variable-length encoding strategy for SNNs, addressing the issue that traditional encoding strategies need to manually set the depth in advance. Furthermore, we propose an exploitation operator focusing on the local search for the variable-length encoding, as well as an exploration operator focusing on the global search based on the temporal expansion.

At present, pelvic floor ultrasound is the primary examination method, but it is not carried out by many primary medical institutions due to the significant shortcomings of training in the early stage and the variable image quality. There has been great progress in the application of deep learning (DL) in image-based diagnosis in various clinical contexts. The main purpose of this study was to improve the speed and reliability of pelvic floor ultrasound diagnosis of POP by training neural networks to interpret ultrasound images, thereby facilitating the diagnosis and treatment of POP in primary care. Methods: This retrospective study analyzed medical records of women with anterior compartment organ prolapse (n=1,605, mean age 45.1±12.2 years) or without (n=200, mean age 38.1±13.4 years), who were examined at West China Second University Hospital between March 2019 and September 2021. Static ultrasound images of the anterior chamber of the pelvic floor (5,281 abnormal, 535 normal) were captured at rest and at maximal Valsalva motion, and four convolutional neural network (CNN) models, AlexNet, VGG-16, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50, were trained on 80% of the images, then internally validated on the other 20%. Each model was trained in two ways: through a random initialization parameter training method and through a transfer learning method based on ImageNet pre-training. The diagnostic performance of each network was evaluated according to accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of each network in the training set and validation set was drawn and the area under the curve (AUC) was obtained. Results: All four models, regardless of training method, achieved recognition accuracy of >91%, whereas transfer learning led to more stable and effective feature extraction. Specifically, ResNet-18 and ResNet-50 performed better than AlexNet and VGG-16. However, the four networks learned by transfer all showed fairly high AUCs, with the ResNet-18 network performing the best: it read images in 13.4 msec and provided recognition an accuracy of 93.53% along with an AUC of 0.852.

Existing methods to alleviate this burden by transmitting compressed gradients often face high compression errors, which slow down the model's convergence. To simultaneously achieve high compression effectiveness and lower compression errors, we study the gradient compression problem from a novel perspective. Specifically, we propose a systematical algorithm termed Extended Single-Step Synthetic Features Compressing (E-3SFC), which consists of three sub-components, i.e., the Single-Step Synthetic Features Compressor (3SFC), a double-way compression algorithm, and a communication budget scheduler. First, we regard the process of gradient computation of a model as decompressing gradients from corresponding inputs, while the inverse process is considered as compressing the gradients. Based on this, we introduce a novel gradient compression method termed 3SFC, which utilizes the model itself as a decompressor, leveraging training priors such as model weights and objective functions. 3SFC compresses raw gradients into tiny synthetic features in a single-step simulation, incorporating error feedback to minimize overall compression errors. To further reduce communication overhead, 3SFC is extended to E-3SFC, allowing double-way compression and dynamic communication budget scheduling. Our theoretical analysis under both strongly convex and non-convex conditions demonstrates that 3SFC achieves linear and sub-linear convergence rates with aggregation noise. Extensive experiments across six datasets and six models reveal that 3SFC outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 13.4% while reducing communication costs by 111.6 times.

Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets, i.e., IU X-ray, MIMIC-CXR, and COV-CTR, demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the recent state-of-the-art medical report generation methods. Ours shows a 9.2% improvement in BLEU-4 score on the IU X-ray dataset, and both BLEU-4 and CIDEr scores improve by 6.31% on the MIMIC-CXR dataset. Additionally, the results show that it can be easily to applied and extended to medical image report generation with different modalities.", "author": "Xu, Liming and Wang, Yongheng and He, Chunlin and Tang, Quan and Zeng, Xianhua and Lv, Jiancheng", "journal": "ACM Transactions on Knowledge Discovery from Data", "publisher": "ACM New York, NY"}
{"type": "article", "key": "liu2025asymmetric", "title": "Asymmetric Visual Semantic Embedding Framework for Efficient Vision-Language Alignment", "abstract": "Learning visual semantic similarity is a critical challenge in bridging the gap between images and texts. However, there exist inherent variations between vision and language data, such as information density, i.e., images can contain textual information from multiple different views, which makes it difficult to compute the similarity between these two modalities accurately and efficiently. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called Asymmetric Visual Semantic Embedding (AVSE) to dynamically select features from various regions of images tailored to different textual inputs for similarity calculation. To capture information from different views in the image, we design a radial bias sampling module to sample image patches and obtain image features from various views, Furthermore, AVSE introduces a novel module for efficient computation of visual semantic similarity between asymmetric image and text embeddings. Central to this module is the presumption of foundational semantic units within the embeddings, denoted as ``meta-semantic embeddings. It segments all embeddings into meta-semantic embeddings with the same dimension and calculates visual semantic similarity by finding the optimal match of meta-semantic embeddings of two modalities. Our proposed AVSE model is extensively evaluated on the large-scale MS-COCO and Flickr30K datasets, demonstrating its superiority over recent state-of-the-art methods.", "author": "Liu, Yang and Liu, Mengyuan and Huang, Shudong and Lv, Jiancheng", "journal": "arXiv preprint arXiv:2503.06974", "year": "2025"}
{"type": "phdthesis", "key": "huang2024selective", "title": "Selective annotation via data allocation", "abstract": "To obtain high-quality annotations under limited budget, semi-automatic annotation methods are commonly used, where a portion of the data is annotated by experts and a model is then trained to complete the annotations for the remaining data. However, these methods mainly focus on selecting informative data for expert annotations to improve the model predictive ability (i.e., triage-to-human data), while the rest of the data is indiscriminately assigned to model annotation (i.e., triage-to-model data). This may lead to inefficiencies in budget allocation for annotations, as easy data that the model could accurately annotate may be unnecessarily assigned to the expert, and hard data may be misclassified by the model. As a result, the overall annotation quality may be compromised. To address this issue, we propose a selective annotation framework called SANT. It effectively takes advantage of both the triage-to-human and triage-to-model data through the proposed error-aware triage and bi-weighting mechanisms. As such, informative or hard data is assigned to the expert for annotation, while easy data is handled by the model. Experimental results show that SANT consistently outperforms other baselines, leading to higher-quality annotation through its proper allocation of data to both expert and model workers. We provide pioneering work on data annotation within budget constraints, establishing a landmark for future triage-based annotation studies.", "author": "Huang, Chen and Deng, Yang and Lei, Wenqiang and Lv, Jiancheng and Dagan, Ido", "year": "2024", "school": "These data should be triaged to experts for annotation rather than the model"}

This paper presents Ferret, a comprehensive framework designed to enhance online accuracy of Online Continual Learning (OCL) algorithms while dynamically adapting to varying memory budgets. Ferret employs a fine-grained pipeline parallelism strategy combined with an iterative gradient compensation algorithm, ensuring seamless handling of high-frequency data with minimal latency, and effectively counteracting the challenge of stale gradients in parallel training. To adapt to varying memory budgets, its automated model partitioning and pipeline planning optimizes performance regardless of memory limitations. Extensive experiments across 20 benchmarks and 5 integrated OCL algorithms show Ferret's remarkable efficiency, achieving up to 3.7× lower memory overhead to reach the same online accuracy compared to competing methods.

Existing methods typically learn a set of embeddings to find the optimal match for each view's text and compute similarity. However, the visual and text embeddings learned through these approaches have limited information capacity and are prone to interference from locally similar negative samples. To address this issue, we argue that the information capacity of embeddings is crucial and propose Dense-to-Sparse Feature Distilled Visual Semantic Embedding (D2S-VSE), which enhances the information capacity of sparse text by leveraging dense text distillation. Specifically, D2S-VSE is a two-stage framework. In the pre-training stage, we align images with dense text to enhance the information capacity of visual semantic embeddings. In the fine-tuning stage, we optimize two tasks simultaneously, distilling dense text embeddings to sparse text embeddings while aligning images and sparse texts, enhancing the information capacity of sparse text embeddings. Our proposed D2S-VSE model is extensively evaluated on the large-scale MS-COCO and Flickr30K datasets, demonstrating its superiority over recent state-of-the-art methods.", "author": "Liu, Yang and Feng, Wentao and Liu, Zhuoyao and Huang, Shudong and Lv, Jiancheng", "journal": "arXiv preprint arXiv:2503.14953", "year": "2025"}

However, cisplatin resistance frequently arises in advanced BCa, limiting therapeutic efficacy. Comparative proteomic analysis of cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant BCa cells identified phosphodiesterase 10A (PDE10A) as significantly downregulated at the protein level in resistant cells, despite unchanged mRNA levels, indicating post-transcriptional regulation. Functional assays demonstrated that PDE10A enhanced cisplatin sensitivity by promoting apoptosis. Mechanistically, the E3 ubiquitin ligase RNF220 directly interacted with PDE10A, facilitating its ubiquitination and degradation under cisplatin-resistant conditions. RNF220 overexpression markedly reinforced cisplatin resistance in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification mediated by METTL3 stabilized RNF220 mRNA in an IGF2BP2-dependent manner. Additionally, RNF220 promoted PD-L1 expression by destabilizing PDE10A, thereby facilitating immune evasion in BCa. These findings establish RNF220 as a pivotal ubiquitinase that drives both cisplatin resistance and immune escape through PDE10A destabilization, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target to enhance chemotherapy and immunotherapy efficacy in advanced BCa.", "author": "Li, Kai and Li, Yongshan and Zhang, Yetao and Lv, Jiancheng and Zhao, Tong and Dong, Yuxiang and Liu, Fuyang and Wang, Jun and Wei, Yong and Zhu, Qingyi", "journal": "Biochemical Pharmacology", "pages": "116903", "year": "2025", "publisher": "Elsevier"}

Many contemporary studies employ sequential generative models. Their standard training method is to sequentialize molecular graphs into ordered sequences and then maximize the likelihood of the resulting sequences. However, the exact likelihood is computationally intractable, which involves a sum over all possible sequential orders. Molecular graphs lack an inherent order and the number of orders is factorial in the graph size. To avoid the intractable full space of factorially-many orders, existing works pre-define a fixed node ordering scheme such as depth-first search to sequentialize the 3D molecular graphs. In these cases, the training objectives are loose lower bounds of the exact likelihoods which are suboptimal for generation. To address the challenges, we propose a unified generative framework named MolEM to learn the 3D molecular graphs and corresponding sequential orders jointly. We derive a tight lower bound of the likelihood and maximize it via variational expectation-maximization algorithm, opening a new line of research in learning-based ordering schemes for 3D molecular graph generation. Besides, we first incorporate the molecular docking method QuickVina 2 to manipulate the binding poses, leading to accurate and flexible ligand conformations. Experimental results demonstrate that MolEM significantly outperforms baseline models in generating molecules with high binding affinities and realistic structures. Our approach efficiently approximates the true marginal graph likelihood and identifies reasonable orderings for 3D molecular graphs, aligning well with relevant chemical priors.", "author": "Zhang, Hanwen and Xiong, Deng and Liu, Xianggen and Lv, Jiancheng", "journal": "Briefings in Bioinformatics", "volume": "26", "number": "2", "pages": "bbaf094", "year": "2025", "publisher": "Oxford University Press"}
